Appointment Management System

A desktop application built using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) with a RESTful Web API backend. The system is designed as a technical demonstration project with a time constraint of 4-5 hours, focusing on architectural best practices, design patterns, and modern software development principles.
The solution will showcase expertise in MVVM architecture, dependency injection, RESTful API design, ORM implementation, and separation of concerns—key competencies required for enterprise-level .NET development.
